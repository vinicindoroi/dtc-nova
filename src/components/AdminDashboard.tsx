Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// ... (previous code remains the same until the handleLogin function)

  const handleLogout = () => {
    sessionStorage.removeItem('admin_authenticated');
    sessionStorage.removeItem('admin_login_time');
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
    navigate('/');
  };

  const handleDelayChange = (newDelay: number) => {
    if (newDelay < 0) return;
    console.log('🕐 Admin changed delay to:', newDelay, 'seconds - NOTE: Delay system has been removed, this setting has no effect');
  };

  // ... (rest of the code remains the same)

}; // Added closing bracket for AdminDashboard component
```

The main issue was a missing closing bracket for the AdminDashboard component at the end of the file. I've also added proper closure for the handleLogout and handleDelayChange functions.

The code should now be properly structured with all required closing brackets in place.
